      If the sun is shining, you belong on the water. Let 3 Amigos Boat Rental take you to where the party is on Lake
       Travis all summer long! Our fleet of brand new Bentley Tritoon Boats are just what you need to cruise the lake in style!

Our captains are friendly and experienced and here to make sure that your trip is everything you want it to be. 
They’ll take you around to all the hot spots on the lake, anchor the boat down and even toss you a cold beverage when you need it.
 No boat trip is complete without great music though and we’ll leave that up to you. Hook your iPhone up directly or use the bluetooth to connect to the on board stereo and be your own DJ for the day!

Austin, Texas has become a destination over the years with so many amazing experiences to take advantage of.
 We started 3 Amigos Boat Rental to share some of our favorites with locals and tourists alike. Texas heat is no joke, 
 but it does allow us to stay out on the water for most of the year and that’s exactly what we plan on doing. So grab your friends, fill up the cooler and don’t forget to bring some sunscreen – we’ll take care of the rest!
